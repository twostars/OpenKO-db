# Dump of the OpenKO database

This is generated by SQL Server Management Studio and currently manually tidied up
to reduce file size.

Ideally we need our own export process to tidy it up consistently (and further than what's already been done),
as well as an import, with version tracking to detect new changes.

For now it's just a basic dump to serve as a better, easier to find reference than the binary database that
needs tracking down in the forums.
